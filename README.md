# ButtonJournal

Ever wondered...
- How many times a day you drink a glass of water?
- How many times a week you have to take out the trash?
- How many times a month you go out to eat?

...but never had a unified place to track those little events that are so easy
to do and forget?

*ButtonJournal* gives you an easy place to record these things as you do them,
and presents summary statistics for their frequency.
